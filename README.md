# Owl lang. v0.3a  (\\^(OvO)^/)

Owl is an interpreted, dynamically typed, procedural language.
It features pascal-like syntax, with C-style scope rules.

Owl's Mascot, (\\^(OvO)^/), is named Flaco, in dedication to the memory of Flaco the Owl who came
to fame for escaping his enclosure in New York City's Central Park Zoo after years of captivity and 
embodies a spirit of freedom in which we can all find inspiration.

# Using Owl

To build owl run the included Makefile by typing 'make' in your terminal and running 'make install' as root. 
Owl requires a C++ compiler which supports C++17 to compile, and has only been tested on linux 
and macOS with G++ and clang++. 

Once built, Owl can be invoked in three different ways:
1) Owl cli - your everyday command line interpreter, owl <options> <filename> will run a supplied owl program
2) Owl repl - a standard read-eval-print-loop. Enter statements and they run as soon as you hit enter, invoked with 
3) Owl shell - this interactive shell lets you load files, run them , display their AST, see memory usage etc, It will soon also feature the ability to step through a program line by line.


# Syntax

This is still very much in development, and as such is subject to change.
this should be viewed as no more than an approximation of Owl's grammar

##  Owl by Example

Recursive Procedures are fully supported making the canonical fibonacci algorithm straight forward to implement
typing is dynamic, so specifying a variables type isnt required, just use the 'let' keyword!

    program 'fibonacci';
    begin
    	let m := 1;
    	func fibR(n: int) begin
        	if (n < 2) then
            		return n;
             	else
            		return fibR(n - 1) + fibR(n-2);
             	end;
    	end
    	while (m <= 13) begin
             	print (fibR(m) + " ");
             	m := m + 1;
    	end;
    	print "\n";
    end

If recusrion isn't you're thing, you can use the while loop for iteration

    program 'fibonacciEx';
    begin
    	let prev := 1;
    	let next := 2;
    	let curr := 0;
    	let x := 1;
    
    	func calcAndPrint() begin
        	next := (prev + curr);
        	print (next + " ");
        	prev := curr;
        	curr := next;
    	end

    	while (x <= 10) begin
        	calcAndPrint();
        	x := (x + 1);
    	end;
    
    	print "\n";
    end

And you can always save yourself a few cycles by cacheing using Owl's array types
arrays can hold mixed types as well, so feel free to mix up your elements!

    program 'fibonacci';
    begin
   	    let m := 1;
    	let cache[15];
    	func fibCached(n: int) begin
	 	    if (n < 2) then
            		return n;
        	else
            		if (cache[n] != 0) then
                		return cache[n];
            		else
                		cache[n] := fibCached(n - 1) + fibCached(n-2);
            		end;
            		print (n + " ");
            		return cache[n];
        	end;
    	end
        while (m <= 13) begin
             	print (fibR(m) + " ");
             	m := m + 1;
    	end;
    	print "\n";
    end

And if you find yourself using your fibonacci procedure in many different programs, you can
package it as a library, and import it into your code, reducing code duplication and encouraging re-use

    library 'fibLib';
    begin
        func fibR(n: int) begin 
        	if (n < 2) then
            		return n;
        	else
            		return fibR(n-1) + fibR(n-2);
        	end;
   	    end;
    end
    
    program 'libtest';
    import fibLib;
    begin
         print (fibR(13) + "\n");
    end;
